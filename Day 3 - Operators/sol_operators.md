## Exercise 1: Declare your age as an integer variable

age = 25

In this exercise, we declare a variable named age and assign it the value of 25. The variable age is of type integer.


## Exercise 2: Declare your height as a float variable

height = 5.7

Here, we declare a variable named height and assign it the value of 5.7. The variable height is of type float.


## Exercise 3: Declare a variable that stores a complex number

complex_num = 2 + 3j

In this exercise, we declare a variable named complex_num and assign it the value of 2 + 3j. The variable complex_num stores a complex number.


## Exercise 4: Calculate the area of a triangle

base = float(input("Enter base: "))
height = float(input("Enter height: "))
area = 0.5 * base * height
print("The area of the triangle is", area)

Here, we prompt the user to enter the base and height of a triangle using the input() function. The values are converted to float using float() for calculation purposes. We then calculate the area of the triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height and store it in the variable area. Finally, we print the calculated area.

## Exercise 5: Calculate the perimeter of a triangle

side_a = float(input("Enter side a: "))
side_b = float(input("Enter side b: "))
side_c = float(input("Enter side c: "))
perimeter = side_a + side_b + side_c
print("The perimeter of the triangle is", perimeter)

In this exercise, we ask the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The inputs are converted to float using float(). We then calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of the three sides together and store the result in the variable perimeter. Finally, we display the calculated perimeter.


## Exercise 6: Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle

length = float(input("Enter length: "))
width = float(input("Enter width: "))
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print("The area of the rectangle is", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is", perimeter)

Here, we prompt the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle. The inputs are converted to float using float(). We then calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width and store it in the variable area. Similarly, we calculate the perimeter by using the formula 2 * (length + width) and store it in the variable perimeter. Finally, we display the calculated area and perimeter.


## Exercise 7: Calculate the area and circumference of a circle

radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius * radius
circumference = 2 * pi * radius
print("The area of the circle is", area)
print("The circumference of the circle is", circumference)

In this exercise, we ask the user to enter the radius of a circle. The input is converted to float using float(). We then calculate the area of the circle using the formula pi * radius * radius, where pi is approximately 3.14. The calculated area is stored in the variable `
